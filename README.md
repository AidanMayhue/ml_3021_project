# DS3021 Machine Learning Project

## Please Git push all of your code once you finish completing a task so we don't do the same work. Also pull all recent work before you start working

## Project Results
### Objectives
- [x]  State a clear prediction question
- [x]  Organize your discussion around two or three key tables or plots or numbers.
- [x]  You can handle criticisms or concerns in the results section if they are relevant or interesting, but most probably belong in the conclusion.

## Pre analysis plan tasks
### Objectives 
- [X] Figure out what method of ML we need
- [X] Create a plan to find a solution
### Writing tasks
**Answer these question** 
- [X] What is an observation in your study?
- [X] Are you doing supervised or unsupervised learning? Classification or regression?
- [X] What models or algorithms do you plan to use in your analysis? How?
- [X] How will you know if your approach "works"? What does success mean?
- [X] What are weaknesses that you anticipate being an issue? How will you deal with them if they come up? If your approach fails, what might you learn from this unfortunate outcome?

## EDA Tasks 
### Writing tasks
**Answer these questions**
- [x] What is in your data?
- [x] How will these data be useful for studying the phenomenon you're interested in?
- [x] What are the challenges you've resolved or expect to face in using them?

### Cleaning data (notebook)
- [x] Cleaned the data

### Create Visuals (notebook)
- [x] Create 5 interesting graphs include titles etc
