**Results**
  Our project consisted of performing principal component analysis and lasso on our data set. Initially the intent was to only perform principal component analysis on the data, but due to concerns with the coefficients we decided to perform lasso as well for a more representative model. 

  Within PCA we found that 18 components within the data were needed to explain 95% of the variance.
