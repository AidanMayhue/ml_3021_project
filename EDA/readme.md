# Question Responses 

### What is in your data?
The combined dataset consists of 1,150 observations and 51 variables, combining freedom, economic, education, employment, and demographic indicators for various countries and regions. We will analyze these variables to create a definition of "freedom". 

Some Key Variables:
1. Freedom & Governance Metrics
   - Status (Free, Partly Free, Not Free)
   - Political Rights (PR) & Civil Liberties (CL) Ratings
   - Total Freedom Score

2.  Education Indicators
   - Gross enrollment ratios (primary, lower secondary, upper secondary) by gender
   - Students enrolled in primary, secondary, and upper secondary education
  
3. Labor Market & Employment
   - Labour force participation (female, male, total)
   - Unemployment rates (female, male, total)
   - Seats held by women in national parliament (%)

4. Crime & Safety Metrics
   - Assault rate per 100,000 population
   - Intentional homicide rates
   - Kidnapping and theft rates
   - Percentage of homicide victims (male & female)

5. Economics & Infrastructure
   - Access to safe drinking water (urban, rural, total)
   - Access to sanitation facilities (urban, rural, total)
   - GDP (constant prices, current prices, per capita GDP)
   - GDP real growth rates (%)

6. Demographics & Population
   - Age distribution (0-14 years, 60+ years)
   - Population density
   - Total population (female, male)
   - Sex ratio (males per 100 females)

7. Internet & Technology Access
   - Percentage of individuals using the internet

### How will these data be useful for studying the phenomenon you're interested in?
This dataset provides comprehensive metrics that allow us to analyze the level of freedom in different countries by examining its relationship with economic, social, and governance factors.

Key Areas of Analysis

1. Measuring Freedom Directly
The dataset includes freedom status classifications (Free, Partly Free, Not Free), along with Political Rights (PR) and Civil Liberties (CL) Ratings. The Total Freedom Score serves as a composite measure that summarizes the overall level of political and civil liberties in a country. By analyzing these indicators, we can directly compare how free different countries are.

2. Freedom & Economic Development
Economic factors such as GDP per capita, GDP growth rate, and employment metrics can help determine whether greater economic prosperity correlates with more political and civil freedom. We can investigate whether countries with higher GDP tend to have stronger political rights and civil liberties. The dataset also includes labour force participation and unemployment rates, which might indicate whether strong economies promote personal freedom through job opportunities and financial stability.
  
3. Freedom & Education
Education levels are closely linked to political awareness and engagement. The dataset includes: Gross enrollment ratios (Primary, Secondary, and Upper Secondary). Student enrollment figures for different education levels. Seats held by women in national parliamentsâ€”a measure of gender equality in governance. These indicators can help assess whether countries with better education systems have stronger democracies and more freedoms.

4. Freedom & Public Safety
Countries with high crime and homicide rates may experience greater restrictions on freedom due to instability, conflict, or government control. This dataset includes: Assault and homicide rates per 100,000 population. ALso includes: Kidnapping, theft, and sexual violence rates. We can explore whether high crime correlates with reduced political and civil freedoms, or if authoritarian regimes with low reported crime still limit freedom in other ways.

5. Freedom & Infrastructure/Access to Resources
The dataset includes access to clean water and sanitation facilities, which are important for quality of life. Internet usage rates can serve as a proxy for freedom of information and expression. We can examine whether countries with better infrastructure and digital access are more likely to be classified as "Free."

6. Freedom Across Regions & Over Time
The dataset allows us to analyze freedom trends by region (e.g., Americas, Europe, Africa, Asia). By using the Edition (year) variable, we can explore how freedom has changed over time and identify countries that have gained or lost freedom.

Some potential questions we can look at:
- Does economic prosperity lead to more political and civil freedom?
- Do countries with better education systems have stronger democracies?
- Are high-crime countries more likely to experience government-imposed restrictions on freedom?
- How does access to technology and infrastructure impact political rights and civil liberties?
- Which regions have seen the greatest improvement or decline in freedom over time?

### What are the challenges you've resolved or expect to face in using them?
Here are some issues we may have, potential resolutions will have to created when or if faced with these issues:

1. Data Cleaning & Missing Values
Challenge: Some variables contain missing values, especially in economic, education, and crime indicators. Missing data can bias analysis or limit the number of available observations.

2. Inconsistent Data Formatting & Data Types
Challenge: Some columns, like numerical indicators with commas need to be converted to proper numeric format. Categorical variables like "Freedom Status" need to be encoded properly for statistical analysis.

3. Interpreting Freedom Metrics & Potential Bias
Challenge: The Freedom House Index (used for classifying countries as "Free," "Partly Free," or "Not Free") is based on expert assessments.
These ratings may be subjective or reflect geopolitical biases, especially in politically contested regions.

4. Correlation vs Causation in Freedom Analysis
Challenge: While we can measure correlations between economic, social, and governance factors and freedom levels, this does not establish causation. For example, does higher education lead to more freedom, or do freer societies invest more in education?

5. Overlapping Factors
Challenge: Many variables in the dataset are highly correlated (e.g., GDP per capita and education levels). Using too many similar variables can distort regression models and produce misleading results.
