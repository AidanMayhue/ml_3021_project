1. **Our Research Question** (1–2 paragraphs)  **(Done By Rameez)**
 * What are you trying to predict? Why is it interesting?  

- Does economic prosperity lead to more political and civil freedom
  
Rameez answer:
This study aims to investigate the relationship between economic prosperity and levels of political and civil freedom across countries. Specifically, we are looking to answer the question, Does economic prosperity lead to more political and civil freedom? This is a central question in international development, as many policymakers debate whether improving economic indicators (such as GDP growth, education, or internet access) correlate with or cause democratic reforms and greater civil liberties.

Understanding this relationship is crucial. If economic growth fosters freedom, then investing in development may lead to stronger institutions and better human rights. On the other hand, if no clear relationship exists or if prosperity can exist without freedom, it may challenge assumptions about global democratization. This question also has implications for foreign aid, international diplomacy, and long-term peacebuilding. Which are all topics that are prevalent today. 

2. **Observation Definition** (a couple sentences)  **(Done By Rameez)**
   * What is a single data point/ what does a row in our dataset represent in our study?
  
  Rameez answer:
  Each row in our dataset represents a country-year observation, combining political freedom scores and various economic indicators for a specific country in a specific year. In this study, a single data point reflects how politically free a country was in a given year and what its corresponding economic conditions were at that time. ​

3. **Our Prediction Type** (1 paragraph)  
   * Supervised vs. unsupervised? Classification or regression?
  
   We intend on using regression methods for our data, it would not make sense to track economic prosperity in terms of classification since the data in regards to economic prosperity is purely quantitative. We are using supervised learning methods as we already have the variables available and intend on using them to identify relationships between the variables.

4. **Planned Models and Methods** (2ish paragraphs)  
   * Which models are we going to use? Why? How will we tune or evaluate them?
  
     

5. **Success Metrics** (1 paragraph)  
   * How will we know that the the model is working? What metrics are we using?
  
     

6. **Anticipated Challengess** (1 paragraph)  
   * What are some potential challenges that we might face during the project
  
     

7. **Feature Engineering / Prep Work** (optional, 1 paragraph)  
   * How are we preparing the data before utilizing it for models and analysis
  
     

8. **Results Presentation Plan** (optional, 1 paragraph)  
   * How are we going to present the findings, graphs, charts,
